## About the project

The goal of this project is to train the software engineering skills of the team and create a simple but powerful command line tool that allows anyone to generate a simple static website with only a couple of markdown files and configuration files.

Executing it should result in the following result

## Usage

- `statique init PATH`

Initialise the static website to the given path. Make sure you have the permission to do so. For now, it creates a config file (`config.json`) and an index.md. In another iteration we might allow you to directly specifies those information.

-  `statique build PATH` 

Convert the different markdown file present in the path into hmtl files.

- `statique clean PATH`

Remove the build folder inside the path

- `statique serve PATH`
